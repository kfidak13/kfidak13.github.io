# 3d Scanner Journal


## Motivating questions

Can a small, low-cost sensor reliably detect real-world distances?

What level of accuracy is realistic before moving into full prototyping?

Is the sensor stable enough to support a future scanning device?

How does power level affect sensor behavior and consistency?

# Materials

5 V Arduino (initial tests)

Compact distance sensor (80cm)

Basic wiring + breadboard setup

Target objects placed at known distances

Excel/Sheets for logging readings and making calibration plots

# Step-by-step process

Set up the sensor on the Arduino and record real-world distances.

Capture multiple readings at each distance to test stability.

Plot measured vs. actual distance to look for patterns or error trends.

Begin planning the next phase: moving to a 12 V system and eventually integrating stepper motors.

# How it unfolded (testing phase results)

Initial readings at 5 V showed somewhat noticable inconsistency.

Patterns emerged when plotted — the data followed a line but needed correction.

Observed that the sensor behaved better when mounted securely and kept at consistent angles.

These early findings helped shape our ideas for a future scanning/movement mechanism.
