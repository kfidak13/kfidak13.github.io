# About Me
I am Kaydon and my goal in the Tech and Innovation Seminar is to gain a deeper understanding of how to create and bring ideas to life. I want to explore the process of turning imagination into something tangible, whether that be through technology, design, or problem-solving. Some of the experiences that have shaped me most involve community service. Through volunteering, I have learned the importance of giving to others rather than focusing only on myself. These opportunities have shown me the value of empathy, responsibility, and teamwork, and they continue to influence the way I approach challenges.

Another source of inspiration for me comes from watching people who can confidently stand in front of a crowd and communicate their thoughts without hesitation. Their ability to connect with others and share information with clarity motivates me to build confidence in my own voice and presentation skills. Looking ahead, one of my major goals is to create a meaningful project during this seminar—something that represents my growth and creativity. I hope it will be a project I can look back on years from now as a reminder of the progress I made and the experiences that shaped me during this time.



## Project Nameplate
Over the course of the past month, my fellow innovators and I have learned and explored new tools and new methods to designing and creating, I have created this page to display some of the things that I have created over the course of project nameplate.

### Digital Design
When designating roles for making the nameplates I signed myself up for the mock up team. Me and my partner went through multiple designs, testing and changing over and over again until we felt comfortable bringing a piece of work to the class. Below I will list display a few of the designs that I have created.

### Adobe Illustrator
One thing that I am proud to say that I have learned is Adobe Illustrator. I used it quite frequently throughout the project, so I became quite comfortable with it, learning all the controls and everything that comes with it. I can now say that whenever I need to design something digitally I can go and use Adobe Illustrator. For more reference view the pictures above, as there are numerous more designs that are very similar. 

### Final Design
Although I can not take credit for the tremendous amount of work my fellow innovators have put in, I can say that I did partially help with the design template, but everything else is coming from them. I will display what our classrooom has designed over the course of the past month.
