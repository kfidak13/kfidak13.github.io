# Innovator’s Journal – Reading Habit & Life Organization Website

## Overview
In this sprint, I followed a three-phase design process (WHO, WHAT, HOW) to identify a real user problem, explore solutions, and build a working prototype. My goal was to design a tool that helps students stay consistent with reading and daily habits by improving organization, reminders, and tracking.

This journal documents my process, stakeholder insights, technical experimentation, and reflection.

## Phase 1: WHO – Understanding the Stakeholder

### Stakeholder Interview
I interviewed **Joshua Hong**, a student focused on self-improvement and expanding his knowledge outside of traditional school learning.

### Stakeholder Goals
Joshua expressed a clear desire to grow intellectually through independent learning:

> “My main goal is just… to get smarter, not necessarily through school. I think mainly through books and like movies and maybe podcasts.”

He also explained that he wants to broaden the types of content he consumes:

> “A lot of my reading history has been centered around fiction, and so this year I’ve been trying to branch out.”

---

### Pain Points Identified
A major issue Joshua described was **fragmentation between tools**:

> “I just don’t like how a lot of my organizational tools are separated from each other… the calendar, the reminders, and this other habit tracker app.”

He questioned why reminders and calendars are split at all:

> “Reminders are really just things that are gonna happen on the calendar day, so I don’t really see why we have to have two separate things.”

---

### Habit Tracking Frustrations
Joshua currently uses a habit tracker but finds it limiting:

> “You get five free slots pretty much… if you want to add more habits, then you gotta pay for the other version, which I’m not doing.”

He also mentioned that some habits feel outdated but remain because of app limitations:

> “Since September, I think I’ve had the same five habits pretty much… some of them are just kind of outdated.”

---

### Reading Tracking Issues
Joshua tracks his reading using spreadsheets, but dislikes the experience:

> “I don’t like Excel and Google Sheets… it works, but it’s not as accessible as I would like it to be.”

---

### Convergent Insight
From the interview, I narrowed the core problem to:

> Students want a **single, simple system** that combines reading tracking, habits, reminders, and calendars without unnecessary complexity or paywalls.

---

## Phase 2: WHAT – Defining the Problem and Exploring Solutions

### Problem Statement
How might we design a digital tool that helps students stay consistent with reading and daily habits by reducing tool overload and improving organization?

---

### Divergent Ideation
Based on the interview, I brainstormed multiple features:
- Reading logs
- Daily habit tracking
- Calendar integration
- Reminder notifications
- Goal-based tracking

Joshua even suggested the idea of consolidation himself:

> “It would just be like a daily life app where you have the calendar… reminders… habit trackers… and the books you’re reading.”

---

### Convergent Decision
I selected features that directly aligned with Joshua’s expressed needs:
- Reading log (instead of spreadsheets)
- Calendar view
- Built-in reminders
- Habit tracker without artificial limits

These features directly addressed the fragmentation problem he described.

---

## Phase 3: HOW – Building the Solution

### Chosen Solution
I built a **website prototype** that combines:
- Reading log
- Calendar
- Reminder system
- Habit tracker

I chose to use **Lovable** to quickly prototype and experiment with AI-assisted development.

---

### Technical Challenges
At first, working with Lovable was difficult. I struggled with:
- Understanding how the platform structured code
- Translating my ideas into effective prompts
- Editing generated components

However, once I understood the workflow, progress accelerated.

---

### Breakthrough Moment
After learning how Lovable organized its code and logic:

> The code started flowing, and building became much more intuitive.

This marked a shift from frustration to confidence.

---

## Two-Week Sprint Breakdown

### Week 1: Research and Planning
- Conducted stakeholder interview with Joshua Hahn
- Identified pain points around fragmented tools
- Defined problem around consistency and organization
- Brainstormed multiple solution ideas
- Converged on a unified website solution

---

### Week 2: Prototyping and Execution
- Learned Lovable’s development workflow
- Built reading log functionality
- Added calendar and reminders
- Implemented habit tracking
- Refined layout and usability

---

## Final Outcome
The final outcome was a working website prototype that allows users to:
- Log daily reading
- Plan and visualize tasks on a calendar
- Receive reminders
- Track habits in one place

This solution directly responds to the stakeholder’s desire to reduce app overload and improve consistency.

---

## Reflection and Learning

### What I Learned About Myself as an Innovator
**Strengths:**
- Persistence through technical difficulty
- Willingness to adapt when tools were confusing
- Ability to connect user needs directly to features

**Areas for Growth:**
- Learning tools earlier before building
- Testing features sooner
- Reducing scope earlier in the process

---

### What I Learned About Stakeholders
- Users value simplicity over advanced features
- Paywalls reduce long-term engagement
- Organization matters more than aesthetics

---

### What I Learned About the Design Process
- Interviews prevent designing based on assumptions
- Diverging before converging improves outcomes
- Clear problem definition saves time during development

---

### What I Learned About Technical Tools
- AI tools accelerate development but require understanding
- Prompt clarity matters
- Generated code still needs human decision-making

---

## Conclusion
This experiment helped me understand the importance of stakeholder-driven design, iterative development, and persistence. By following the WHO, WHAT, and HOW process, I created a meaningful solution and grew as an innovator.
