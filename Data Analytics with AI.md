# Data Analytics
During our journey in our personal projects, I decided to pursue Data Analytics. Due to my inability to code overly efficient I have become comfortable with the coding app Windsurf. Using this allows me to be in detail with the code and have a copilot on the side to correct mistakes made or even make the code more efficient.

Up to this point, I have a functioning website that has a somewhat stable code. The app, at the moment, tends to have errors, which I have been working to fix. One major problem is that the code fails to fetch the code in a mannerly amount of time, so it will time out. A possible solution to this would be to extend the amount of time before it times out, but it shouldn't take that long anyway.
